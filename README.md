# My NixOS config

That repo contains my nixos config based on [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

``config`` folder goes to ``/etc/config`` and ``nixpkgs`` folder goes to ``~/.config/nixpkgs``

The ``templates`` folder contains some examples on how to use nix shells for custom environments, mostly for development
